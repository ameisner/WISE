Retrieving WISE PSF Model
=========================
Check out a copy of the WISE/pro and WISE/etc contents. The FITS files 
containing the PSF models are in WISE/etc. Set the WISE_DATA environment 
variable to the directory in which you place these FITS files. To retrieve a 
PSF cutout, use wise_psf_cutout.pro.

Important Keywords
==================
For historical reasons, all IDL routines apply to the Preliminary Release
by default. As a result, it is necessary to set the allsky keyword to 1 when
using these IDL routines. The IDL routines default to W3. The "bands" keyword,
an integer 1-4, now dictates the band of interest. For backward compatibility,
the w4 keyword still exists and sets band=4.

Notes on Fluxes and Magnitudes
==============================
The flux of a point source with catalog magnitude w?mpro (in L1b DN) is given 
by:

flux = 10^((magzp-w?mpro)/2.5)

Where magzp is given by the parameter magzp in psf_par_struc.pro, and flux
is measured in an aperture of radius 0.46 (0.92) arcmin in W3 (W4).

Latent Model Details
====================
The parameter latim (latim2) in psf_par_struc.pro gives the file name 
containing the first (second) latent model. These models are scaled to 
w?mpro = 0 for all bands. The first latent is nonlinear in parent
source flux, with amplitude given by:

amplitude(w?mpro) = corr*amplitude(w?mpro = 0)*10^(-w?mpro/2.5)

Where corr is a scalar correction factor that can be retrieved using 
latent_nonlin_corr.pro. Such a nonlinearity correction coefficient
was found to be unnecessary for the second latent model in both W3, W4.

The first latent is much less pronounced in W1, W2 than in W3, W4 and
looks qualitatively different. Nevertheless, I have created a model
analogous to those in W3, W4 that can be accessed in the same way. The W1, W2 
second latents have not been modeled since these weak feature are very poorly 
detected in single exposures, even for the very brightest high-latitude 
sources.

Revised W1, W2 v1 PSFs
=============
Since, in certain regions near the W1/W2 PSF core it became clear that 
third order polynomials did not adequately capture the PSF variation, I have
created revised PSFs that incorporate higher order polynomial coefficients (up
to fifth order) in x,y. These models are etc/psf_coeff-w?.v1.fits, and I 
recommend these be used rather than the earlier PSF models. wise_psf_cutout.pro
now uses the v1 models by default, but is backwards compatible so that 
reverting the psf_par_struc.pro parameter fpsf to its previous value of 
psf_coeff-w?.fits makes use of the original third order W1/W2 PSF models.
