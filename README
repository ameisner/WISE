Retrieving WISE PSF Model
=========================
Check out a copy of the WISE/pro and WISE/etc contents. The FITS files 
containing the PSF models are in WISE/etc. Set the WISE_DATA environment 
variable to the directory in which you place these FITS files. To retrieve a 
PSF cutout, use wise_psf_cutout.pro.

Important Keywords
==================
For historical reasons, all IDL routines apply to the Preliminary Release
by default. As a result, it is necessary to set the allsky keyword to 1 when
using these IDL routines. The IDL routines default to W3; set the w4 keyword to
1 when W4 is desired.

Notes on Fluxes and Magnitudes
==============================
The flux of a point source with catalog magnitude w?mpro (in L1b DN) is given 
by:

flux = 10^((magzp-w?mpro)/2.5)

Where magzp is given by the parameter magzp in psf_par_struc.pro, and flux
is measured in an aperture of radius 0.46 (0.92) arcmin in W3 (W4)

Latent Model Details
====================
The parameter latim (latim2) in psf_par_struc.pro gives the file name 
containing the first (second) latent model. These models are scaled to 
w?mpro = 0 for both W3 and W4. The first latent is nonlinear in parent
source flux, with amplitude given by:

amplitude(w?mpro) = corr*amplitude(w?mpro = 0)*10^(-w?mpro/2.5)

Where corr is a scalar correction factor that can be retrieved using 
latent_nonlin_corr.pro. Such a nonlinearity correction coefficient
was found to be unnecessary for the second latent model in both bands.
